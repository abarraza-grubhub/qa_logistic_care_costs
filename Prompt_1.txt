You are an expert SQL analyst. Your task is to perform a detailed, column-level logical analysis of the provided SQL query.
You will analyze each Common Table Expression (CTE) individually and present your findings in a structured Markdown format.

Your analysis must be based only on the information provided in the "fulfillment_care_cost.sql" and
 "Breaking Down Logistic Care Costs Query.md" documents in this repository.
 Do not use any external information or assumptions.

Guiding Principles
No Hallucination: Your primary directive is to be 100% factual. Do not invent business logic, assume column meanings, or guess the purpose of a calculation.

Question All Ambiguity: If the source of a column is unclear, if the logic behind a CASE statement isn't explained in the context, or if a hardcoded value (e.g., WHERE status = 'active') seems arbitrary,
you must state this as a question in the 'Notes / Questions' column. Do not make an assertion. For example, instead of saying "This filters for active users," you should ask, "Question: The context doesn't define what status = 'active' represents. Can the business logic for this filter be confirmed?"

Be Methodical: Analyze each CTE in the order it appears in the query. For each CTE, create a separate section with a Markdown table.

Clarity is Key: Explain the logic in simple, clear English.

When something is unclear, aside from adding question, you can provide your own interpretation of
what the logic might be, but clearly label it as "[Interpretation]" and ensure it's clear that this is not a fact but an interpretation.

*Task*
Create a branch, and in the branch add a commit with the output Markdown file named "CTE_Analysis.md" containing your analysis.

Required Output Structure and Format for CTE Analysis
Begin your analysis now. For each CTE in the query, create a separate section with a Markdown heading and a table that follows this exact structure:

CTE: [Name of the CTE]
Purpose: A brief, one-sentence summary of what this CTE accomplishes based on the provided context and the SQL logic.

Column Name	Source	Derivation Logic	Notes / Questions
[Column_1_Name]	table_name.source_column or Previous_CTE.column_name	Explain the logic here (e.g., "Direct selection from the source.")	State questions about this column here, if any.
[Column_2_Name]	table_name.source_column_A, table_name.source_column_B	Explain the calculation (e.g., "Calculated as source_column_A multiplied by source_column_B.")	Question: The context doc doesn't specify the business rule for this multiplication. Can this be clarified?
[Column_3_Name]	N/A	CASE statement logic (e.g., "Categorizes the record as 'High Value' if order_total > 1000, otherwise 'Standard'.")	Question: Are the thresholds for 'High Value' documented anywhere?
[Column_4_Name]	table_name.timestamp_column	Window function logic (e.g., "Assigns a unique row number for each customer_id, ordered by timestamp_column descending.")
