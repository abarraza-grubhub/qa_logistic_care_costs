# Optimization & Validation Analysis

## Analysis Summary

This analysis examines the fulfillment care costs SQL query to identify potential data type optimizations and filter efficiency improvements. The query is complex, involving multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) that process order-level data from various sources to calculate fulfillment care costs.

**Key Findings:**
- Multiple columns likely use suboptimal data types based on naming conventions and usage patterns
- Several filter operations could potentially be pushed down to earlier CTEs for improved performance
- Date parsing operations may benefit from optimization
- JOIN operations involve potential data type mismatches requiring explicit casting

**Limitations:** This analysis is based solely on query structure and provided context documentation. We do not have access to database execution plans, data statistics, or actual column data types from the database schema.

## Section 1: Data Type Efficiency

Based on column names, context, and common database conventions, the following columns may benefit from data type optimization:

| CTE Name | Column Name | Inferred Data Type | Suggested Data Type | Justification & Analysis | Required Validation Code (in Python script) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| adj | ticket_id | VARCHAR/TEXT | BIGINT | Column is used in joins and appears to be a numeric identifier. The query explicitly casts it with CAST(ar.ticket_id AS BIGINT), suggesting the source may be VARCHAR. | Check if all ticket_id values are numeric and within BIGINT range |
| adj | adjustment_dt | VARCHAR | DATE | The query uses DATE_PARSE(CAST(adjustment_dt AS VARCHAR), '%Y%m%d'), indicating it's stored as string in YYYYMMDD format. Native DATE type would be more efficient. | Validate all adjustment_dt values follow YYYYMMDD format and can be converted to DATE |
| cancels | primary_cancel_reason_id | Various | INTEGER | Query casts both sides of join: CAST(crm.cancel_reason_id AS VARCHAR) = CAST(ocf.primary_cancel_reason_id AS VARCHAR), suggesting type mismatch. Should standardize to INTEGER. | Check data type consistency and range for primary_cancel_reason_id across tables |
| cancels | cancellation_ticket_id | VARCHAR/TEXT | BIGINT | Query explicitly casts: CAST(ocf.cancellation_ticket_id AS BIGINT), indicating source is likely VARCHAR but should be BIGINT for efficiency. | Validate all cancellation_ticket_id values are numeric and fit in BIGINT range |
| care_fg | expiration_dt | VARCHAR | DATE | Similar to adjustment_dt, uses DATE_PARSE(CAST(expiration_dt AS VARCHAR), '%Y%m%d'), indicating string storage that should be DATE type. | Validate all expiration_dt values follow YYYYMMDD format and can be converted to DATE |
| mdf | region_uuid | VARCHAR(36) | UUID | Column name suggests UUID data type. If database supports native UUID type, it would be more storage efficient than VARCHAR(36). | Check if region_uuid values are valid UUID format and consider native UUID type if supported |
| o | time_local | TIME | TIME | Currently derived from datetime_local with string concatenation and casting. More efficient to store/compute as native TIME type. | Validate TIME calculations and consider direct TIME column derivation |
| Final Output | total_care_cost | FLOAT/DOUBLE | DECIMAL(15,2) | Represents monetary values. FLOAT/DOUBLE can cause precision issues with financial calculations. DECIMAL ensures exact precision. | Check for precision issues in financial calculations and validate decimal places |

## Section 2: Filter Application (Correctness & Efficiency)

### Filter Correctness

Based on the context document, the filters appear to correctly implement the described business logic:

1. **Date Range Filters**: The query uses a "+/- 1 Day Logic" approach, expanding the date range by one day on each side to capture related events. This is documented as intentional design.

2. **Managed Delivery Filter**: `managed_delivery_ind = TRUE` correctly filters for Grubhub-managed deliveries (GHD) as described in the context.

3. **Care Contact Filter**: `cpo_contact_indicator = 1` correctly filters for "worked" care contacts, excluding automated contacts that don't have ticket costs.

4. **Adjustment Direction Filter**: `direction = 'ADJUST_DOWN'` and `payer = 'GRUBHUB'` correctly identify Grubhub-paid refunds.

### Filter Efficiency (Pushdown Opportunities)

Several filters could potentially be applied earlier in the query for improved performance:

1. **Date Filtering in o CTE**: The managed_delivery_ind filter in the o CTE could be applied earlier in the mdf CTE, reducing the dataset size before the expensive JOIN operation.

   ```sql
   -- Current: Filter applied after JOIN in o CTE
   WHERE managed_delivery_ind = TRUE
   
   -- Suggested: Apply in mdf CTE
   WHERE mdf.business_day BETWEEN ... AND managed_delivery_ind = TRUE
   ```

2. **Null Order UUID Filter**: The `order_uuid IS NOT NULL` filter in the contacts CTE could be applied to other CTEs that select order_uuid to reduce processing of invalid records.

3. **Decision Filter in ghg CTE**: The `decision = 'GRANT'` filter is correctly applied early in the ghg CTE, which is good practice.

4. **Direction and Payer Filters in adj CTE**: These filters are correctly applied early in the adj CTE, which is optimal.

**Hypothesis**: Moving the managed_delivery_ind filter to the mdf CTE would reduce the number of rows processed in subsequent JOINs, potentially improving query performance significantly since this filter eliminates non-GHD orders early in the pipeline.

### Potential Optimization Areas

1. **Date Parsing Operations**: The repeated use of `DATE_PARSE(CAST(column AS VARCHAR), '%Y%m%d')` could be optimized if the source columns were stored as proper DATE types.

2. **Explicit Type Casting in JOINs**: Multiple JOINs require explicit casting, indicating potential schema inconsistencies that could be addressed for better performance.

3. **REGEXP_LIKE Operations**: The extensive use of REGEXP_LIKE for reason categorization in the o CTE could potentially be optimized with lookup tables or simpler string operations.

4. **COALESCE Operations**: Multiple COALESCE operations for date calculations could be simplified if source data quality were improved.

## Validation Requirements

The Python validation script should test the following hypotheses:

1. Verify that ID columns (ticket_id, cancellation_ticket_id, etc.) contain only numeric values
2. Validate date string formats for adjustment_dt and expiration_dt columns  
3. Check UUID format validity for region_uuid columns
4. Analyze precision requirements for financial columns
5. Assess the impact of filter pushdown by estimating row counts at different stages
6. Validate that type casting operations don't introduce data loss
